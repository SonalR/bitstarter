	<h3>The Problem</h3>
	<p><strong>In India the judiciary does not have a separate income or budget and is funded by the state governments. Due to criminals in the parliament both at the centre and state level protecting themselves from prosecution the following problems have arisen:</strong></p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Reduced judicial spending</strong>, results in:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Too few courts, judges, law colleges, jails and police to implement the law.</li>
	      <li>Lack of adequate digitization of court procedures</li>
	      <li>Lack of quality judges as sometimes good lawyers do not want to be judges as they are likely to earn more as lawyers</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Recruitment of the corrupt</strong> - legal, investigative and security personnel who will protect/ not prosecute the criminal recruiters are enrolled more so now that the executive i.e. the government gets a say in judicial appointments.</li>
	  <li><strong>Weakened Laws</strong> - Tampering with laws that would implicate the criminals in power</li>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="row-fluid section2" id="result">
      <div class="span10 offset1 copy">
	<h3>The Result</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Long time for justice</strong>: civil suits take between 15 to 20 years to be resolved while criminal suits take 8-10 years</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Due to paucity of judges</li>
	    <li><strong>Lack of digitization - extremely difficult to read reams of meandering averments or denials often poorly stated, explained and substantiated and even tougher to follow the trail of responses and correlate the evidence supplied. People evading the law use ambiguity and volume to delay the judicial process causing the current huge list of pending cases and failure of justice.</strong></li>
	  </ul>
	  <li><strong>No justice even after biding your time:</strong></li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>many times corrupt cops, lawyers can be bribed to act against the best interests of the victims</li>
	    <li>Some Judges find it difficult to make correct decisions due to lack of digitization making their job difficult</li>
	    <li>Some Judges might be corrupt</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li><strong>More Crimes</strong> - Criminals can commit crimes with no compunction as they are assured of getting away with it for a long time or completely</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Encroach property</li>
	    <li>Steal misappropriate</li>
	    <li>Crimes against women and children</li>
	    <li>Corruption asking for favours in cash or kind for to perform official duties (scams)</li>
	    <li>Terrorism</li>
	    <li>Extortion, blackmail</li>
	    <li>Contracts are not enforceable</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li><strong>Loss to Exchequer</strong> - scams or misappropriation of public funds has resulted in a large national loss leading to:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Loss of Investor confidence resulting in an outflow of foreign funds/ investments leading to devaluation of the currency</li>
	    <li>Loss of tourism due to lack of safety for tourists</li>
	  </ul>
	</ol>

    </div>



    <div class="row-fluid section3" id="current">
      <div class="span10 offset1 copy">
        <h3>The Current Situation</h3>
	<p>Although the Indian judiciary has the following IT systems:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>A scheduling system (List of Business Information System (LOBIS)) that enables the Registries of Supreme Court and High Courts in eliminating manual process of Cause List generation thus any manipulation by vested interests. These databases contain details of fresh cases, disposed and pending cases. It is the backbone application of every Court.</li>
	  <li>A case status information online disbursal via COURTNIC</li>
	  <li>A Judgement Information System (JUDIS) consisting of complete text of all reported judgement of Supreme Court of India from 1950 to till Date.</li>
	  <li>And a e-filing system in the Supreme Court and the Company Law Board in Mumbai which is the ability to submit the softcopy of your lawsuit online</li>
	</ol>
	<p>It still needs further digitisation. The above picture taken in 2003 of an empty courtroom of the High Court in Mumbai city shows a newly renovated courtroom with many reference books on the judge's podium. The table in front of him is laden with 2 plastic tubs full of case papers left behind. All of these voluminous case papers tied with string is what the judge is supposed to read and pass judgment on after referring to all laws and judgments applicable. It is easy to see why this is a herculean task if this is one s work as it often is. Paucity of judges aside even if we were to imagine a team of 50 people doing the same job it would be extremely difficult.</p>
	<p><strong>THERE IS NO SYSTEM TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE SUIT ITSELF. Even the softcopy of the suit has to be read just like the hard copy would, page by page.</strong></p>
	<p>The current format for both the civil and criminal petition/ complaint has the following parts:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>The introduction of the petitioners and the respondents in the civil, and the complainant and the accused in the criminal suit</li>
	  <li>The articles of the Indian constitution/ penal code that apply to the petition/ complaint.</li>
	  <li>How the parties to the petition/ complaint met, followed by a chronological sequence of events including the events in which the alleged crime/s happened along with their substantiation</li> 
	  <li>A list of prayers</li>
	</ol>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="row-fluid section4" id="solution">
      <div class="span10 offset1 copy">
	<h3>The Solution</h3>
	<p>Only the above highlighted problems can be solved without the need of all/ majority policy makers concurring. Therefore the only solution to help this situation is to automate some of the tasks carried out by the lawyers and judge by digitization.</p>
	<p>UPAMANA means to have knowledge through comparison in sanskrit. This is the name of a wizard that a lawyer uses on behalf of his clients to file either a civil petition or a criminal complaint. This wizard allows the upload of scanned supportings alongside chronological averments. The court and the judge respectively decide whether the proof uploaded is valid and whether it corroborates the averment. The respondent or accused get to respond to each averment with their own proof uploads. Again the court and judge respectively decide whether these are valid and corrobates the defence. Only the corroborated averments of both are given as a synopsis along with applicable laws and past judgments. This synopsis is presented to the judge for his verdict.</p>
      </div>    
    </div>



    <div class="row-fluid section2" id="benefits">
      <div class="span10 offset1 copy">
        <h3>The Benefits of Digitization</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>The court or other agencies can check whether the proof submitted is valid i.e. if they say it is a bank statement of a particular period then it is in fact that and not the drawing of a flower</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>This saves the judges time</li>
	    <li>Prevents people from wasting the courts time to evade justice</li>
	    <li>Helps the judge to narrow down the argument by paying attention to substantiated points</li>
	    <li>Prevents corruption as different agencies can check proofs submitted within a single suit also the same proof in a suit can be verified by different agencies and the result must be the same.</li>
	    <li>Allows the entity filing the suit to create a database of proofs they can refer to for the duration of the suit without having to reattach it in further replies/ affidavits.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li>The Judge/s can check to see if the proof corroborates the averment that refers to it</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The judge does this anyway as s the only way he can arrive at a judgement but if he can verify corroborating proofs then he can treat a denial of the same as a lie and arrive at a judgement more quickly and with much more assurance.</li>
	    <li>Parties in a dispute looking to evade the law by stating baseless denials and false statements will be automatically deterred from wasting every s time.</li>
	    <li>This will automatically lead to shorter cases and quicker and more resolute judgements</li>
	    <li>Less corruption as different judges/ senior councils across the state can be used to check each point also each point can be checked by multiple judges/ senior councils to get the same result.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li><strong>Once justice in ensured to a better extent than before many tools such a PIL (public interest litigation) can be used to effectively check government/ other mismanagement.</strong></li>

	  <li>Invalid proofs should be fined Rs.2,000/- each.</li>

	  <li>The same court and judicial process follows for the denial and fresh description.</li>
